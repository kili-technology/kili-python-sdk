            Metadata fields are by default interpreted as `string` types. To change the type
            of a metadata field, you can use the `update_properties_in_project` function with the
            metadata_types argument. `metadata_types` is given as a dict of metadata field names
            as keys and metadata types as values.
            Example:
            ```
            kili.update_properties_in_project(
                project_id = project_id,
                metadata_types = {

            Not providing a type for a metadata field or providing an unsupported one
