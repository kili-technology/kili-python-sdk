        !!! Info "Issues or Questions"
            An `Issue` object both represent an issue and a question in the app.
            To create them, two different methods are provided: `create_issues` and `create_questions`.
            However to query issues and questions, we currently provide this unique method that retrieves both of them.

        Args:
            project_id: Project ID the issue belongs to.
            asset_id: Id of the asset whose returned issues are associated to.
            asset_id_in: List of Ids of assets whose returned issues are associated to.
            issue_type: Type of the issue to return. An issue object both represents issues and questions in the app.
            status: Status of the issues to return.
            fields: All the fields to request among the possible fields for the assets.
                See [the documentation](https://docs.kili-technology.com/reference/graphql-api#issue) for all possible fields.
            first: Maximum number of issues to return.
            skip: Number of issues to skip (they are ordered by their date of creation, first to last).
            disable_tqdm: If `True`, the progress bar will be disabled
            as_generator: If `True`, a generator on the issues is returned.

        Returns:
            An iterable of issues objects represented as `dict`.
