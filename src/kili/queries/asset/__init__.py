        !!! example "How to filter based on label categories"
            The search query is composed of logical expressions following this format:

                [job_name].[category_name].count [comparaison_operator] [value]
            where:

            - `[job_name]` is the name of the job in the interface
            - `[category_name]` is the name of the category in the interface for this job
            - `[comparaison_operator]` can be one of: [`==`, `>=`, `<=`, `<`, `>`]
            - `[value]` is an integer that represents the count of such objects of the given category in the label

            These operations can be separated by OR and AND operators

            Example:

                label_category_search = `JOB_CLASSIF.CATEGORY_A.count > 0`
                label_category_search = `JOB_CLASSIF.CATEGORY_A.count > 0 OR JOB_NER.CATEGORY_B.count > 0`
                label_category_search = `(JOB_CLASSIF.CATEGORY_A.count == 1 OR JOB_NER.CATEGORY_B.count > 0) AND JOB_BBOX.CATEGORY_C.count > 10`
