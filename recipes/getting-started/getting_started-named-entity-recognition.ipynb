    "## What is named entity recognition<a id='ner'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first key concept to understand is what is Named Entity Recognition (NER). NER is a sub-task of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories such as names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, etc. NER has many use cases, such as anonymization of documents containing personal data. This is especially applicable to use cases involving protected data such as medical documents or court decisions. To make things more concrete, let's examine an example. Let's say we this text to label:\n",

    "\n",
    "This task is easy for a human: recognizing nouns, adjectives, and verbs. But this process is actually helpful for a machine to learn to recognize nouns and other things in a document. Training a machine learning model requires large quantities of annotated assets. With Kili, you can label your data efficiently. In this tutorial, we will create our project on NER step by step.\n",
    "\n",
