    "# Image semantic segmentation\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll show you how to start with an image semantic segmentation project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is image semantic segmentation\n",
    "The task of image semantic segmentation consists of detecting specific regions of objects within an image. In concrete terms, this means detecting the shape of objects of different categories in images. Each category is composed of objects that all have common features. For example, we will consider the task of image semantic segmentation for the categories “Circle” and “Square.” We'll then try to identify these objects in our images knowing that circles are round and squares have four edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In image semantic segmentation, our goal is not only to identify the presence of given objects, but also to identify their positions, dimensions, and shape. This requires work at the pixel level in order to classify every single pixel of the object. This can be achieved in an approximate way by drawing the shape of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below, you'll find an example of Kili's interface for image semantic segmentation for an image of a Tesla car.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kili-technology/kili-playground/master/recipes/img/getting_started/semantic-tesla.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using image object detection can be very helpful in domains such as facial recognition, medicine, self-driving cars, etc. It's especially interesting to be able to automate this process, but to achieve good performance it's generally necessary to have large quantities of labeled data. A great way to label your data efficiently is using Kili. The next steps of this tutorial will walk you through the creation of your first semantic segmentation project at Kili.\n",
