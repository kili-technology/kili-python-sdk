    "# Image classification\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show you how to start with an image classification project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is classification <a id='classification'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important concept to understand is classification. The idea of classification is to assign categories to assets from a fixed set of categories.\n",
    "You can classify any kind of asset: image, text, video, PDF, etc. For clarity, we will use images in this tutorial.\n",
    "To make things more concrete, let's examine an example. Suppose that we want to classify this car:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kili-technology/kili-playground/master/recipes/img/getting_started/car.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have the asset we want to classify (in this case an image of a car). Then we have the possible classes. The interface shows two possible classes: *Object A* and *Object B*. This could be customized to be for example *Car* or *Cat*; the important thing about classification is to know that we have a fixed set of possible classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A human can easily classify this image as a car; however, in many situations, it can be useful to automate this process. With this in mind, we could also train a machine learning model to classify our image. To train a powerful model; however, we would need large quantities of labeled data (in this case, images with classes already assigned). Kili provides an excellent way to classify your data. The next step of this tutorial will walk you through the creation of your first classification project at Kili.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the steps in this tutorial; feel free to jump ahead some steps if you've already done some previous tutorials:\n",

    "1. [Connecting to Kili](#connecting)\n",

    "## Connecting to Kili <a id=\"connecting\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to be able to connect to the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask your organization admin to create your profile. When your profile is ready, depending on the authentication implementation you can:\n",
    "- Sign up and set your password with first login.\n",
    "- Sign up using the temporary password provided to you by the admin.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use the SaaS version of Kili, by default you use the Auth0 login identification, or your company's authentication, if it has been implemented:\n",

    "\n",
    "You can either create a project from the graphical user interface or from the API.\n",

    "To create a new image classification project from the graphical user interface:\n",
    "1. Click on the Kili logo in the top-left corner of the screen to get to your project list.\n",
    "2. From the project list, click `Create New`.\n",
    "3. Type your project name and description.\n",
    "4. Select your asset type (`Image`).\n",
    "5. Select your project type (`Image Classification [single-class]`).\n",
    "6. Click `Save`.\n",

    "<summary style=\"display: list-item;\"> Follow these instructions to create an image classification project from the API</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "From the API, you can create a project with a single call, which allows you to store and share project interfaces : \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect to Kili:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Authentication\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# !pip install kili # uncomment if you don't have Kili installed already\n",
    "from kili.client import Kili\n",

    "\n",
    "kili = Kili(api_endpoint=api_endpoint)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set up project interface:\n",

    "interface = {\n",
    "  \"jobs\": {\n",
    "    \"JOB_0\": {\n",
