        "\n",
        "The first important concept to understand is classification. The idea of classification is to assign categories to assets from a fixed set of categories.\n",
        "You can classify any kind of asset: image, text, video, PDF, etc. For clarity, we will use images in this tutorial.\n",
        "To make things more concrete, let's examine an example. Suppose that we want to classify this car:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kili-technology/kili-playground/master/recipes/img/car.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "First we have the asset we want to classify (in this case an image of a car). Then we have the possible classes. The interface shows two possible classes: *Object A* and *Object B*. This could be customized to be for example *Car* or *Cat*; the important thing about classification is to know that we have a fixed set of possible classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A human can easily classify this image as a car; however, in many situations, it can be useful to automate this process. With this in mind, we could also train a machine learning model to classify our image. To train a powerful model; however, we would need large quantities of labeled data (in this case, images with classes already assigned). Kili provides an excellent way to classify your data. The next step of this tutorial will walk you through the creation of your first classification project at Kili.\n",
