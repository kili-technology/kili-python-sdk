        "## What is object detection<a id='intro'></a>\n",
        "\n",
        "The task of object detection consists of detecting instances of objects in an asset. In this tutorial, we're interested in image object detection. In concrete terms, this means detecting the presence of objects of different categories within images. Each category is composed of objects that all have common features. For example, we’ll consider the task of image object detection for the categories *Circle* and *Square*. We'll then try to identify these objects in our images, knowing that circles are round and squares have four edges.\n",
        "\n",
        "In image object detection, our goal is not only to identify the presence of given objects, but to identify their positions and dimensions. This can be achieved in an approximate way by using bounding boxes. A bounding box is defined as the smallest rectangle that completely covers an object in a given image. By using bounding boxes, we can get information about the position of an object (the center of the box) as well as its dimensions. The main advantage of using bounding boxes is that their representation is very simple (just the position of four lines).  \n",
        "\n",
        "In the image below, you'll find an example of Kili's interface for image object detection for an image of a car. We use a single bounding box to represent a car.\n",

        "Using image object detection can be very helpful in domains such as facial recognition, medicine, etc. It's especially interesting to be able to automate this process; however, to achieve good performance, it's generally necessary to have vast amounts of labeled data. A great way to label your data efficiently is using Kili. The next steps of this tutorial will walk you through the creation of your first image object detection project at Kili. \n",
