    "# Kili Tutorial: How to leverage Counterfactually augmented data to have a more robust model\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this study, the authors point out the difficulty for machine learning models to generalize the classification rules learned, because their decision rules, described as 'spurious patterns', often miss the key elements that affect most the class of a text. They thus decided to delete what can be considered a confusion factor, by changing the label of an asset at the same time as changing the minimum amount of words so those **key-words** would be much easier for the model to spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll:\n",
    "1. Create projects in Kili, both for IMDB and SNLI datasets, to reproduce such a data-augmentation task, in order to improve our model and decrease its variance when used in production with unseen data.\n",
    "2. Try to reproduce the results of the paper, by using similar models, to show how such a technique can be of key interest while working on a text-classification task.\n",
    "We'll use the [publicly available data of the study](https://github.com/acmi-lab/counterfactually-augmented-data) for both IMDB and Stanford NLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an overview of Kili, visit our [website](https://kili-technology.com) or check out the Kili [documentation](https://docs.kili-technology.com).\n",
    "For a more on-hands experience, you can run some of the other recipes.\n"
