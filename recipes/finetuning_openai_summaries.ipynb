      " when the recommended antiretroviral and obstetric interventions are used , a woman who knows of her hiv infection early in pregnancy now has a less than 2% chance of delivering an hiv - infected infant . without intervention , this risk is approximately 25% in the united states [ 36 ] . \n",
      " testing for hiv began in 1985 with the introduction of the enzyme immunoassay ( eia ) . in order to account for false positive results using screening tests in a low - prevalence population \n",
      " , confirmatory testing has been implemented using a western blot or immunofluorescence assay .   in a low - prevalence population , \n",
      " the false positive rate using the eia is increased compared to a high - prevalence population , and the positive predictive value of any test will always depend on the prevalence of the condition in the population tested .   in testing performed by the cdc , \n",
      " the eia positive predictive value ranges from 71 to 83% in populations with hiv prevalence from 0.5 to 1% . \n",
      " some investigators believe that the presence of alloantibodies account for the increased false positive rate associated with pregnancy , transfusions , transplantation , and autoimmune diseases .   however , risk factors specific to pregnancy that account for this are poorly understood . \n",
      " conversely , a recent large retrospective study found that the false positive hiv eia rate was lower in pregnant women compared to nonpregnant individuals ( 0.14% versus 0.21% ) . \n",
      " our objective was to determine if any maternal characteristics correlated with false positive hiv eia testing at delivery . \n",
      " this was a review of all women who delivered at parkland memorial hospital in dallas , tex , from october 1 , 2005 through september 30 , 2008 . \n",
      " all women routinely received serum hiv testing at their initial prenatal visit and at time of presentation to labor and delivery for delivery via the opt - out approach with the abbott commander hiv ab hiv-1/hiv-2 ( rdna ) eia ( abbott laboratories , abbott park , ill ) . \n",
      " hiv test results performed at the time of delivery were analyzed in this study . a woman was considered hiv negative if eia testing was negative . \n",
      " positive test results were confirmed with the fluorognost immunofluorescent assay ( ifa ) hiv-1 ( sanochemia corp , stamford , conn , usa ) . \n",
      " women were considered to be falsely positive if eia results were positive and the ifa was negative . \n",
      " women delivered in this time period were identified through the obstetric operations database and linked to the pathology database for hiv , hepatitis b surface antigen ( hbsag ) , and rapid plasma reagin ( rpr ) results . \n",
      " maternal characteristics , including race , parity , age , singleton versus multiple gestation , and a diagnoses of diabetes or hypertension were obtained using the obstetrics operations database . \n",
      " laboratory results drawn 28 days prior to delivery through seven days after delivery were included . \n",

      " compared to hiv negative patients , false positive patients were more likely to be nulliparous ( 43% versus 31% , p < 0.001 ) and younger ( mean age 23.9  5.7 versus 26.2  5.9 , p < 0.001 ) . \n",
      " hiv positive patients were significantly older than false positive patients ( 27.4 versus 23.9 , p < 0.001 ) and hiv negative patients ( 27.4 versus 26.2 , p = 0.012 ) . \n",
      " of the 47,794 women , 47,391 ( 99% ) were hiv negative , 145 ( 0.3% ) had a false positive test , 172 ( 0.4% ) were true positives , and 86 ( 0.2% ) tested equivocal or were missing hiv results . \n",
      " the specificity of the hiv eia test was 99.7% with a positive predictive value of 54.3% . \n",
      " the sensitivity of the eia test was presumed to be near 100% , as the false negative rate using the eia has been previously demonstrated to be negligible in studies performed by the manufacturer . \n",
      " table 2 shows the prevalence of diabetes , hypertension , hepatitis b , and results of syphilis testing in the study population . \n",
      " hiv positive women were more likely to test positive for hepatitis b surface antigen ( 1% versus 0% , p = 0.002 ) and rpr ( 2% versus 0% , p = 0.02 ) . \n",
      " there was no significant difference in the prevalence of diabetes or hypertension between the three groups . \n",
      " there was also no significant difference in the rate of hbsag and rpr positivity between the hiv negative and false positive groups . \n",
      " when evaluating the interaction between nulliparity and age , there is a significant correlation between the two variables ; that is , parous patients are likely to be older and , therefore , nulliparity and age are not independent predictors of hiv false positivity . \n",
      " however , when the hiv testing groups ( positive , false positive , negative ) are stratified by parity , the comparison of age across the three groups remains significant only in nulliparous women ( table 3 , p = 0.0003 ) . \n",
      " the interaction between parity and age means that the difference in age between nulliparous and parous women is different depending on the hiv status . \n",
      " for example , in the hiv positive group the nulliparous and parous women are closer in age than in the false positive group . \n",
      " this was the first population - based study to evaluate risk factors for hiv false positivity in pregnant women presenting for delivery at a large urban institution . \n",
      " we found that younger and nulliparous women were more likely to have false positive testing using the hiv eia . \n",
      " the observed positive predictive value ( ppv ) of 54.3% was lower than the previously reported by the cdc ( ppv 7183% ) in a nonpregnant population , suggesting that pregnancy may be associated with a higher rate of false positivity . \n",
      " the low positive predictive value of the hiv eia in our study may have been impacted by the relatively low hiv prevalence ( 0.4% ) in our population . \n",
      " this information could be useful for counseling women who test positive for hiv at delivery and emphasizes the limitations of eia testing if used as a rapid test to determine the need for intrapartum and neonatal antiretroviral prophylaxis . \n",
      " the false positive rates of currently available rapid hiv tests have been reported to be much lower than has been found with eia testing in this study . \n",
      " evaluated the hiv false positive rate in over 900 pregnant women , most of whom were hispanic , using both the eia and a rapid point - of - care ( poct ) test , oraquick . \n",
      " they found that while there were no false positive tests with the oraquick , there were seven false positives using the eia ( ppv 100% versus 35.7% ) . in the mother - infant rapid intervention at delivery ( miriad ) \n",
      " study , jamieson et al . found that the ppv of the oraquick test was 90% while the ppv of the eia was 74% [ 12 , 13 ] . \n",
      " current recommendations by the cdc and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists include rapid hiv screening for women presenting to labor and delivery with undocumented hiv status and for repeat hiv testing in the third trimester for women at high risk or who live in areas with high hiv prevalence [ 7 , 14 , 15 ] . \n",
      " a woman testing preliminarily positive for hiv in labor should be counseled that she may have hiv infection and that her neonate may be exposed , and immediate antiretroviral prophylaxis should be recommended without waiting for confirmatory test results . \n",
      " the results of our study may aid in counseling women if they test preliminarily positive for hiv using the eia , while awaiting confirmatory testing results . \n",
      " it remains to be determined whether the same risk factors for false positive hiv eia testing apply to the poct tests used in a real life setting . \n",
      " our study found that the positive predictive value of eia testing was only 54.3% and that younger nulliparous women were more likely to test falsely positive . \n",
      " importantly , our data may represent the real world performance of the eia testing in a large obstetric population - based setting . \n",
      " investigators also have noted a significant relationship between influenza vaccination and false positive screening for hiv antibodies [ 1618 ] . \n",
      " a potential reason for this cross reactivity is that there are similarities in homology between the transmembrane domains of the influenza envelope protein hemagglutinin and the hiv-1 envelope proteins . in our population \n",
      " , there were no significant differences in age or parity and influenza vaccination acceptance rates ( unpublished data ) . \n",
      " women in our study were from a single institution , with a predominantly hispanic background , and therefore the results may not be applicable to all populations \n",
      " .   reasons for false positive hiv serology may vary depending on the geographical region .   while we did find a significant association between young age , nulliparity , and hiv false positive testing , \n",
      " our study does not have the capability to identify a causal relationship or explain why this association may exist . \n",
      " in addition , our study can not address if these same risk factors for false positive testing apply to all other hiv tests . \n",
      " further studies are needed to confirm our findings , elucidate the biological mechanisms for increased hiv eia false positivity in young , nulliparous women , and compare this conventional testing method with contemporary rapid screening assays , including poct .\n"

The initial MRI was unremarkable, but a later evaluation showed conus medullaris syndrome and a conus infarct. The article also mentions a search of the PubMed database for similar cases and discusses the potential benefits and risks of ESI. It emphasizes that while this severe complication is rare, its true incidence is unknown. The article suggests that the rarity of this complication should not lead to the discontinuation of transforaminal ESI, but rather it should be discussed with patients during the consent process. The article also discusses the potential causes of spinal cord infarction during ESI, including direct arterial injection and embolic incidents. It mentions the importance of adhering to standard techniques and guidelines to prevent complications. The article concludes by stating that while the risk of permanent neurologic deficit is negligible, patients should be informed about the potential risks of ESI, including paralysis. It suggests that the continued use of transforaminal ESI should be considered for select patients, but the consent process should include discussion of this rare complication.', 'initial_confidence_score': 0.6476221258134517}\n"

The affected scalp skin appears pale and smooth, with a loss of follicular orifices and signs of inflammation. The cause of this condition is still unknown, but it is believed to be a variant of lichen planopilaris, a type of lichen planus that affects the hair follicles. A case study of a 60-year-old woman with frontal fibrosing alopecia and nail involvement was presented.

Frontal fibrosing alopecia is considered a generalized process of inflammatory scarring alopecia, with symptoms extending beyond the hairline to include loss of eyebrows, eyelashes, peripheral body hair, and nail involvement.

The participants had to touch the square that matched the color of the initial square as quickly as possible. Both the chimpanzees and humans responded faster when a high or low tone was played in the background that matched the color of the square. This demonstrates that animals, like humans, exhibit crossmodal correspondences, which are matches between different sensory dimensions.\n",

It is important to note that there is no evidence of conscious synaesthetic experiences in chimpanzees.\n",

It is also possible that once certain statistical regularities are learned, the mind/brain acquires the correspondence between lightness and pitch.\n",

These results provide the first experimental evidence for cross-modal mappings of the type underlying grapheme-color synaesthesia in humans in a non-human species, the chimpanzee. They also suggest that the human capacity for symbolic representation may have foundations that are shared with non-human species and may have evolved from capacities that were present in our common ancestor rather than arising de novo (e.g. via a mutation or recombination subsequent to the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages).</td>\n",

Studies have shown that PCD is overexpressed in breast cancer tumors and functions as an autocrine growth factor in various types of cancer cells. Decreased expression of PCD has been found to inhibit tumor growth. PCD is also implicated in paracrine communication with surrounding cells, stimulating their proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. It has been shown to play a role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Additionally, PCD may be involved in angiogenesis during cancer progression. Current diagnostic assays for cancer are antigen-based, but the use of these assays has not been widely accepted. Research has shown the presence of anti-PCD autoantibodies, which could serve as a non-invasive screening test for cancer. PCD has also been found to play a role in wound healing, tissue remodeling, and programmed cell death. Its secretion is not only linked to cancer cells but also plays a role in normal physiological conditions. Some functions of PCD are independent of its protease activity and rely on its ability to interact with other molecules.

Procathepsin D is a major glycoprotein that is overexpressed in various human cancers and is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Procathepsin D is synthesized as an inactive precursor and is proteolytically processed to the mature form in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments. The mature form of procathepsin D is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and the activation of growth factors, cytokines, and receptors. Procathepsin D is also secreted into the extracellular space, where it promotes tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading extracellular matrix proteins. In addition, procathepsin D induces apoptosis by a caspase-independent mechanism. This review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which procathepsin D contributes to tumor progression and discusses the potential clinical applications of procathepsin D as a therapeutic target and a prognostic marker for cancer.</td>\n",

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which p62 regulates RANK expression. We found that p62 interacts with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of RANK mRNA and that this interaction is required for the regulation of RANK expression by p62. Furthermore, we identified that the RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR) is involved in the p62-mediated regulation of RANK expression. p62 was found to interact with HuR and to enhance the association of HuR with RANK mRNA. The p62-mediated stabilization of RANK mRNA was abrogated by depletion of HuR, indicating that HuR is required for the p62-mediated stabilization of RANK mRNA.
