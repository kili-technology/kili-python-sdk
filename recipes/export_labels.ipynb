    "# Kili Tutorial: Exporting a training set\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of using Kili to export a training. The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate some basic components and concepts of Kili in a simple way, but also to dive into the actual process of iteratively developing real applications in Kili.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally:\n",
    "\n",
    "For an overview of Kili, visit kili-technology.com\n",
    "You can also check out the Kili documentation https://cloud.kili-technology.com/docs.\n",
    "Our goal is to export labels that can predict whether an image contains a Porsche or a Tesla.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided into four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a project\n",
    "2. Settings up the labeling interface\n",
    "3. Labeling\n",
    "4. Exporting the training set with the API\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Creating the project\n",
    "\n",
    "On Kili homepage (https://cloud.kili-technology.com/label/projects), click on the top right button **Create new**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then enter a project title, project description and project type **Image classification (single-class)** and click on save.\n",
    "\n",
    "![create project](img/export_labels-create_project.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is created with to images by default so you can start playing with Kili.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Settings up the labeling interface\n",
    "\n",
    "When created, click on the project and then on settings.\n",
    "In settings, change to names of the categories to *Porsche* and *Tesla*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![update settings](img/export_labels-update_settings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Then click on start labeling and label some images.\n",
    "\n",
    "![label images](img/export_labels-label_images.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Exporting the training set with the API\n",
    "\n",
    "To export assets you will need the ID of the project. You find it in the url of you browser when you are on this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "![copy project id](img/export_labels-copy_project_id.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This next cell connect the notebook to the Kili API. You need to update the credentials `email`, `password` and `project_id` before."
