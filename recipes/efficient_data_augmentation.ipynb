    "As algorithm grow more complex, they also grow hungry for more data, to be able to learn precisely the meaning of the sentence. In Text Classification task for example, the variety of words encountered allows for a much more resilient algorithm, especially when in production with a taste of real word data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in Computer Vision where biases such as detecting a seagull is more correlated with the presence of the beach rather than the bird itself, words in NLU can be baddly associated with an incorrect class and can thus be a threat in the case of real world use, as examples get harder to discriminate. \n",
    "If automatic generation of new data can be of help in simply **increasing the number of training example**, how good is it performing against the use of **more training data from the same dataset**, and **are there way to efficiently generate more data** ?\n",

    "In this study, the authors point out the difficulty for Machine Learning models to generalize the classification rules learned, because their decision rules, described as 'spurious patternes', often miss the key elements that affects most the sentiment of a text. They thus decided to  confusion factor, by changing the label of an asset at the same time as changing the minimum amount of words so those **key-words** would be much easier for the model to spot.\n",

    "In the article *Learning the Difference that Makes a Difference with Counterfactually-Augmented Data*, the authors created a new labelling task based on the IMDB dataset. On a subset of reviews, it was asked the annotators to change the class of the review by changing the minimum of words in the review. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sentence : \n",
    "*Long, boring, blasphemous. Never have I been so glad to see ending credits roll.*\n",
    "became : *Long, fascinating, soulful. Never have I been so sad to see ending credits roll.* \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use in this study **different machine learning models, and analyze their performance on the original data to understand how well counterfactual data can improve performance on this text classification task**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental setup\n",
    "1. Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is collected from the original IMDB dataset and the study presented above. It is a subset of review written on the IMDB website, along with a sentiment (Positive or Negative). The task for the algorithm is to classify properly each of the reviews.\n",
    "Here, we will use both the counterfactually generated reviews and the original reviews, and also a combination of both.\n",
    "\n",
    " More precisely, we will use those 4 datasets :\n",
    " - the *original* dataset, a subset from the imdb dataset\n",
    " - the *revised* dataset created in the study from variations of the original dataset\n",
    " - the *combined* dataset, combining the two previous datasets\n",
    " - the *originalDouble* dataset, enlarging the original dataset with more reviews from the imdb dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pipeline\n",
    " - Each dataset, including the original IMDB dataset is split in a balanced way between a training, validation & test dataset.\n",
    " - For the text processing, no pre-processing is applied to the original reviews. \n",
    " - The reviews are encoded, for the machine learning models, with a TF-IDF bag-of-words approach. We first compute the term frequency (t is the evaluated term and d the review)\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm {tf} (t,d) = f_{t,d}{\\Bigg /}{\\sum _{t'\\in d}{f_{t',d}}}$$\n",
    " And then the inverse document frequency (D is the ensemble of all the reviews) : \n",
    "  $$\\mathrm{idf}(t, D) =  \\log \\frac{N}{|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And use those values to determine which words or bigrams are kept. We keep in this study conservative parameters, with unigrams and bigrams, the 75% less represented words of the corpus, except those present in less than 5 documents, limiting to 20000 words in total.\n",
    " \n",
    " - We then conduct a grid search on a dedicated validation dataset, specific to each model.\n",
    " - Final results are computed for all datasets, on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Models\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose different enough models, to grab a better sense of the type of circumstances in which counterfactual data can be of help. The models tested are the sklearn implementation of : \n",
    " - SVM : A Support Vector Machine classifier.\n",
    " - RF : A Random Forest classifier\n",
    " - DecisionTree : A DecisionTree classifier\n",
    " - XGB : A XGBoost Classifier\n",
    " - LogisticRegression : A Logistic Regression classifier\n",
    " - KNN : A K - Nearest Neighbors Classifier\n",
    " - SGD : A Stochastic Gradient Descent implementation of SVM\n",
    " - NB : A Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use Keras to implement a Neural Network for sequence models :\n",
    " - LSTM : A bi-LSTM Neural Network, with a 300 words * 20000 words Word Embedding, a Max Pooling Layer, a Bidirectionnal LSTM, and 2 fully connected layers. The loss is used is the Adam Optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric used is the **accuracy**, as the dataset is balanced so it is not biased for this task and metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\texttt{accuracy}(y, \\hat{y}) = \\frac{1}{n_\\text{samples}} \\sum_{i=0}^{n_\\text{samples}-1} 1_{(\\hat{y}_i = y_i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building a more resilient dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest of such a technic is primarily to help the model grab a better sense of the useful words that really encapture the meaning of the sentence. As a matter of fact, a model trained on the original data fails to score better than random guess on counterfactual out-of-sample data.\n",
    "The opposite is also true, a model trained on counterfactual data scores very poorly on original data, not better than random guess on out-of-sample data. \n"

    "- For some models, like Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors, which are simple models, performance is better for the model with counterfactually generated data. The increase from almost 1% for KNN and almost 3 % for Naive Bayes can be explained by the much more explicit data provided. \n",

    "It seems that there are three mains interest to use counterfactual data augmentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Its impact on the performance for text classification can be as good, and even better to using more original data. In particular, we notice that simple model leverage greatly the counterfactual data strengths to be more stable and offer a State of the Art performance that is easy to iterate on. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Furthermore, counterfactual data provides a resilience to the model towards data that can be considered as adversarial. In the case of a fully trained model, a great stabilisation is provided by counterfactual data. It allows the model to be in mean 1% more accurate accross all models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Yet, the model of generation being so precise and systematic, it is **far easier to generate than collecting original data**. The original data gathering can as a matter of fact be really tedious and suffers from exhaustion, because it often relies on synthetic data, for examples in the chatbot use cases. In the beginning especially, we generate data syntetically to onboard the first users, but imagination has its limits. The counterfactual alternative guarantees, for real-world use case, a gain in factor 3 in terms of cost for the same final performance, and in quality of data as it does not suffer from the exhaustion issues. Ultimately, it allows in being at the same time weal\n",

    "We studied here the case of text classification, but this could be done for many others fields of NLU, for examples Named entities recognition or intention classification. One of the primary use of this technic could thus be the **development of chatbots**, in which all those tasks are of primary concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For future work, we want to focus on those other tasks, but also be able to generate more counterfactual data than original, and analyze the performance in those case. For this, we are going to explore leads to generate massively revised data, with technique such as machine translation or massive data augmentation techniques."
