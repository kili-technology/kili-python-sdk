    "As algorithm grow more complex, they also grow hungry for more data, to be able to learn precisely the meaning of the sentence. In Text Classification task for example, the variety of words encountered allows for a much more resilient algorithm, especially when in production with a taste of real word data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in Computer Vision where biases such as detecting a seagull is more correlated with the presence of the beach rather than the bird itself, words in NLU can be baddly associated with an incorrect class and can thus be a threat in the case of real world use, as examples get harder to discriminate. \n",
    "If automatic generation of new data can be of help in simply **increasing the number of training example**, how good is it performing against the use of **more training data from the same dataset**, and **are there way to efficiently generate more data** ?\n",

    "In this study, the authors point out the difficulty for Machine Learning models to generalize the classification rules learned, because their decision rules, described as 'spurious patternes', often miss the key elements that affects most the sentiment of a text. They thus decided to  confusion factor, by changing the label of an asset at the same time as changing the minimum amount of words so those **key-words** would be much easier for the model to spot.\n",

    "In the article *Learning the Difference that Makes a Difference with Counterfactually-Augmented Data*, the authors created a new labelling task based on the IMDB dataset. On a subset of reviews, it was asked the annotators to change the class of the review by changing the minimum of words in the review. For example, the sentence : \n",
    "*Long, boring, blasphemous. Never have I been so glad to see ending credits roll.*\n",
    "became : *Long, fascinating, soulful. Never have I been so sad to see ending credits roll.* \n",

    "The opposite is also true, a model trained on counterfactual data scores very poorly on original data, not better than random guess on out-of-sample data. \n"

    "It seems that there are two mains interest to use counterfactual data augmentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Its impact on the performance for text classification can be as good, and even better to using more original data. Furthermore, counterfactual data provides a resilience to the model towards data that can be considered as adversarial. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Yet, the model of generation being so precise and systematic, it is **far easier to generate than collecting original data**. The original data gathering can as a matter of fact be really tedious and suffers from exhaustion, because it often relies on synthetic data, for examples in the chatbot use cases. In the beginning especially, we generate data syntetically to onboard the first users, but imagination has its limits. The counterfactual alternative guarantees, for real-world use case, a gain in factor 2 to 3 in terms of cost for the same final performance, and in quality of data as it does not suffer from the exhaustion issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We studied here the case of text classification, but this could be done for many others fields of NLU, for examples Named entities recognition or intention classification. One of the primary use of this technic could thus be the development of chatbots, in which all those tasks are of primary concern"
