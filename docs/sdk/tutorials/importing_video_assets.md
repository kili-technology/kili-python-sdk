# How to import video assets to a Kili project

In this tutorial, we will learn how to import video assets to Kili.

Here are the steps that we will follow:

1. Setting up a simple Kili project to work with
2. Importing video assets to Kili
  1. Uploading a video asset using a path to a local file
  2. Uploading a video asset using an URL
  3. Uploading a video asset to label each frame separately
  4. Uploading a list of local images as one video asset
  5. Uploading a list of image URLs as one video asset
  6. Uploading a video asset with a custom sampling rate
3. Updating video metadata
4. Cleanup

## Setting up a simple Kili project to work with

### Installing and instantiating Kili

First, let's install and import the required modules.


```python
%pip install  kili
```


```python
from kili.client import Kili
```

Now, let's set up variables needed to create an instance of the Kili object.

We will need your API key and Kili's API endpoint.

If you are unsure how to look up your API key, refer to [https://docs.kili-technology.com/docs/creating-an-api-key](https://docs.kili-technology.com/docs/creating-an-api-key).


```python
kili = Kili(
    # api_endpoint="https://cloud.kili-technology.com/api/label/v2/graphql",
    # the line above can be uncommented and changed if you are working with an on-premise version of Kili
)
```

### Creating a basic Kili project

To create a Kili project, you must first set up its interface.

We will create a video project with just one simple classification job and two categories: `OBJECT_A` and `OBJECT_B`.

To learn more about Kili project interfaces, refer to [https://docs.kili-technology.com/docs/customizing-project-interface](https://docs.kili-technology.com/docs/customizing-project-interface).


```python
interface = {
    "jobs": {
        "JOB_0": {
            "content": {
                "categories": {
                    "OBJECT_A": {"children": [], "name": "Object A", "id": "category3"},
                    "OBJECT_B": {"children": [], "name": "Object B", "id": "category4"},
                },
                "input": "radio",
            },
            "instruction": "Categories",
            "isChild": False,
            "mlTask": "CLASSIFICATION",
            "models": {},
            "isVisible": True,
            "required": 1,
            "isNew": False,
        }
    }
}

result = kili.create_project(
    title="[Kili SDK Notebook]: Importing Video Assets",
    description="Project Description",
    input_type="VIDEO",
    json_interface=interface,
)
```

For further processing, we will need to find out what our project ID is.

We can easily retrieve it from the project creation response message:


```python
project_id = result["id"]
print("Project ID: ", project_id)
```

    Project ID:  cld90h71d0ha50jptd28xfjg1


## Importing video assets to Kili

Now, let's add some video assets to be labeled.
You can videos using URLs or use your local assets.

We will use a free off-the-shelf asset from the Internet.

### Uploading a video asset using a path to a local file

To show an example of how to upload a local video, we must first download it:


```python
import urllib.request

urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/label-public-staging/asset-test-sample/video/short_video.mp4",
    "test.mp4",
)
```

Now, we can easily upload the video to our project:


```python
assets = kili.append_many_to_dataset(
    project_id=project_id, content_array=["./test.mp4"], external_id_array=["video_1_from_local"]
)
```

### Uploading a video asset using an URL

You can of course upload videos using URLs as well. To do so, simply replace `'./test.mp4'` with the URL of the video that you want to upload.


```python
url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/label-public-staging/asset-test-sample/video/short_video.mp4"

assets = kili.append_many_to_dataset(
    project_id=project_id, content_array=[url], external_id_array=["video_2_from_url"]
)
```

### Uploading a video asset to label each frame separately

To upload your video and be able to label frames separately, as individual images, refer to this code:


```python
url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/label-public-staging/asset-test-sample/video/short_video.mp4"

assets = kili.append_many_to_dataset(
    project_id=project_id,
    content_array=[url],
    external_id_array=["video_2_from_url_split_frames"],
    json_metadata_array=[{"processingParameters": {"shouldUseNativeVideo": False}}],
)
```

### Uploading a list of local images as one video asset

We can create a video, by using local images as frames. Let's first download some images from the Internet:


```python
urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/label-public-staging/Frame/vid2_frame/video2-img000001.jpg",
    "image_1.jpg",
)
urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/label-public-staging/Frame/vid2_frame/video2-img000002.jpg",
    "image_2.jpg",
)
urllib.request.urlretrieve(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/label-public-staging/Frame/vid2_frame/video2-img000003.jpg",
    "image_3.jpg",
)
```

Now, let's put them together as one video:


```python
assets = kili.append_many_to_dataset(
    project_id=project_id,
    json_content_array=[["./image_1.jpg", "./image_2.jpg", "./image_3.jpg"]],
    external_id_array=["video_3_from_local_images"],
    json_metadata_array=[{"processingParameters": {"shouldUseNativeVideo": False}}],
)
```

### Uploading a list of image URLs as one video asset

You can of course upload videos using URLs as well. To do so, simply replace `'./test.mp4'` with a set of URLs of images that you want to upload as a video.


```python
url1 = "https://storage.googleapis.com/label-public-staging/Frame/vid2_frame/video2-img000001.jpg"
url2 = "https://storage.googleapis.com/label-public-staging/Frame/vid2_frame/video2-img000002.jpg"
url3 = "https://storage.googleapis.com/label-public-staging/Frame/vid2_frame/video2-img000003.jpg"

assets = kili.append_many_to_dataset(
    project_id=project_id,
    json_content_array=[[url1, url2, url3]],
    external_id_array=["video_4_from_image_urls"],
    json_metadata_array=[{"processingParameters": {"shouldUseNativeVideo": False}}],
)
```

### Uploading a video asset with a custom sampling rate

To upload a video with a custom sampling rate (let's say, 10 frames per second), use this code:


```python
assets = kili.append_many_to_dataset(
    project_id=project_id,
    content_array=["./test.mp4"],
    external_id_array=["video_5_custom"],
    json_metadata_array=[{"processingParameters": {"framesPlayedPerSecond": 10}}],
)
```

## Updating video metadata

When importing a video, if you want to add or delete metadata, you must provide the entire list of metadata. This new list will replace the previous one, meaning any metadata not included in the new list will be erased. However, this does not apply to the `processingParameters` metadata, which will be retained even if they are not present in the new list.

If you need to update `processingParameters` keep in mind that you should only do it with caution as it can have an impact on how the video will be managed by the application.

To update a `processingParameters`, use this code:


```python
assets = kili.update_properties_in_assets(
    project_id=project_id,
    external_ids=["video_5_custom"],
    json_metadatas=[{"processingParameters": {"framesPlayedPerSecond": 10}}],
)
```

If you have set custom metadatas to your asset, see here [how](https://python-sdk-docs.kili-technology.com/latest/sdk/tutorials/importing_assets_and_metadata/#adding-metadata-to-assets), and you want to update one property you will have to first get all the json_metadatas and then update the wanted metadata :


```python
updated_json_metadatas = kili.assets(
    project_id=project_id, external_id_in=["video_5_custom"], fields=["jsonMetadata"]
)
updated_json_metadatas[0]["jsonMetadata"]["customMetadata"] = 20

assets = kili.update_properties_in_assets(
    project_id=project_id,
    external_ids=["video_5_custom"],
    json_metadatas=[updated_json_metadatas[0]["jsonMetadata"]],
)
```

## Cleanup

We can remove the project that we created:


```python
kili.delete_project(project_id)
```

## Summary

Done. We've successfully set up a video project, defined its interface, and uploaded a bunch of assets to it, using various Kili's upload methods. Well done!
