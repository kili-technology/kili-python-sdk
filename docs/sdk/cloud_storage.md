## Data Integration versus Data Connection

A data integration is a connection between a Kili organization and a remote/cloud storage (AWS, GCP or Azure).
Once a data integration is created, it can be used in any project of the organization.
Adding a data integration from the API is currently not supported. More information about how to create a data integration can be found [here](https://docs.kili-technology.com/docs/adding-assets-to-project#creating-a-remote-storage-integration).

A data connection is a data integration used in a Kili project. It is used to import data from a remote storage to a project.
More information about how to use a data integration in a project can be found [here](https://docs.kili-technology.com/docs/adding-assets-to-project#adding-assets-located-in-remote-storage-integration).
