## What is Kili Technology?

Kili Technology is an image, text, and voice data annotation tool designed to help companies deploy machine learning applications faster. In a few minutes, you can start annotating your data thanks to a catalog of intuitive and configurable interfaces. You can easily accelerate the labeling process by connecting one of your models to pre-annotate the data. The work of the annotators is 2 to 5 times faster. Kili Technology facilitates collaboration between technical teams and the business, but also with outsourced annotation companies. Data governance is managed, and production quality control is facilitated. Kili Technology meets the needs of small teams as well as those of large companies with massive stakes.

Kili Technology allows you to:

- Quickly annotate **text**, **images**, **video**, **audio** and **frames** (3D images, DICOM Images and scans) thanks to simple and intuitive interfaces
- Easily ingest data, in drag & drop, from your cloud provider, or while keeping your data On Premise, when necessary.
- Manage participants, roles and responsibilities
- Monitor production quality using leading indicators and workflows for production monitoring and data quality validation
- Easily export the produced data

## What is Kili Playground?

Kili Playground is a Python client wrapping the GraphQL API of Kili Technology.
It allows data scientists and developers to control Kili Technology from an IDE.

## Installation

- Clone the repository and install with pip

```bash
pip install kili
```

## Get started

- Export an API KEY In `My Account` -> `API KEY` :

![](./recipes/img/api_key.gif)

- Add the `KILI_API_KEY` variable in your bash environment (or in the settings of your favorite IDE):
```bash
export KILI_API_KEY='MY API KEY'
```


- Then instantiate the Kili client:
```python
from kili.client import Kili
kili = Kili()
# You can now use the Kili client!
```
Note that you can also pass the API key as an argument of the `Kili` initialization:
```python
kili = Kili(api_key='MY API KEY')
```
